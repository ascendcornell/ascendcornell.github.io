	<h1 onclick="play()"> Internal Affairs</h1>
	<p>The Internal Affairs Committee is delegated to reaching out to other student organizations on campus. By forming either short-term or long-term alliances, we aim to expand Ascend’s influence on campus and help our members extend their social network. The Internal Affairs Committee is responsible for organizing fundraisers, planning events and workshops, and collaborating with other organizations to maximize member experience.</p>

	<p>This semester we proudly bring to you our first Chocolate Fondue and S’mores Fundraiser; Guest Speaker talks with NSMH, Women in Leadership Hospitality; and our resume critique workshops. We will also be connecting with the Ascend national board through Student Mentoring Programs, Officer Training Programs in fall, Student Appreciation dinner in May and volunteering opportunities in the Ascend Convention. Resources, for example, Ascend scholarship will also be available for our members.</p>
